Choose whether you are using the new asynchronous or old tracking code. Before Google Analytics can report ecommerce activity for your website, you must enable ecommerce tracking on the profile settings page for your website. Also keep in mind that some gateways do not reliably show the receipt page, so tracking may not be accurate in those cases. It is recommended to use the PayPal gateway for the most accurate data. <a href=\"http://analytics.blogspot.com/2009/05/how-to-use-ecommerce-tracking-in-google.html\" target=\"_blank\">More information &raquo;</a>"
