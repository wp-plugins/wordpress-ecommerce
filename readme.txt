== Description ==

MarketPress brings you a solid, simple yet extensible foundation for a WordPress-Powered store.

The first WordPress eCommerce plugin designed from the ground up for seamless integration with WordPress, Multisite and BuddyPress.

We went to great lengths to provide simple shipping and gateway APIs, robust themeing support and a set of completely documented template tags. MarketPress makes full use of custom post types, taxonomies, etc. It creates NO messy custom tables for each blog that crowd your database like other shop plugins out there!

= Make More Money with Multisite and MarketPress Combined! =
Selling your products online is the number one way to make money using WordPress. MarketPress does this expertly for a single user WordPress site. It has also been built specifically to allow you to create a network of stores with Multisite and exponentially increases the profits you can be making with your site.

It does this by allowing you create your own WordPress Network of shops (premium version only), enabling you to take a pre-defined percentage fee on each transaction.  You provide the service of allowing folks to create an entire store with the ease and familiarity of WordPress - and for your efforts you can dictate the percentage provided to you automatically from each transition.

The site works for you.  It couldn't be easier to set up and, once you're done, the automated process allows you to make money while your attention can be diverted elsewhere.  It works for Etsy.  It works for Shoppify.  Now it can work for you!

= Fantastic Themes - Made Easy =

Also available on WPMU DEV, you'll find a Parent and Child Theme (more being added all the time).  This provides the perfect scenario of powerful functionality in the admin and gorgeous display of your products on the public side!  <a href='http://premium.wpmudev.org/project/frame-market-theme'>Check them out today!</a>
