* Works great with any WordPress theme and looks great with AJAXy goodness
* Fully internationalized by the WPML crew

* Shipping, coupons, Google Analytics Ecommerce tracking, sale pricing, unlimited product variations, and so so much more!

And, did you know that MarketPress is also 100% WordPress Multisite and BuddyPress compatible - so **you can use it to start your own Etsy or Ebay style network of stores... where you take a % on each sale!!!**

So, what are you waiting for, download MarketPress today and give it a crack.

Or, read on to find out more about what you can get from MarketPress...

= Sick of WP-ecommerce? =
One of the main reasons we developed MarketPress was because, basically, so many of the existing WordPress ecommerce plugins out there offer a pretty awful user experience. WP-ecommerce being the most popular, we built a complete importer - allowing you to easily import your troublesome WP-ecommerce store into MarketPress... hurrah!

= Want to make your product listings look amazing? =
MarketPress is 100% customizable, but in case you don't want to get stuck into all that CSS, it comes with:

* Amazing themes (that you can customize without knowing a single line of code)
* Beautiful preset CSS styles
* Powerful, yet elegant, widgets 
* Hot product thumbnails/images with lightbox zooming

And when it comes to the actual sales, we've got every feature you could ask for, including (but not limited to):

* Payment gateways coming out of our ears
* 100% ready for easy translation into any language
* Supports all major currencies
* Ready to go for tax and VAT
* Digital or physical objects
* Multiple shipping options
* Coupons, discounts and affiliate ready
* Fully integrated with Google Analytics eCommerce
* Unlimited product variations
* Stock tracking and alerts per variation
* Per order product limits
* AJAX cart and cart widget
* Powerful shortcodes that you can use anywhere
* Link any product to an external link (helooo Amazon affiliates!)
* Categories and tags
* Stock tracking and order management and alerts
* Fully customizable urls
* Checkout *without* having to be a site user
* Start your own Etsy shopping network
* Global shopping carts (for that network)

And that's really just the beginning, there's so much more, but the only way you'll get to find out about that is to try it...

We guarantee that it's simply the best - what else would you expect from WPMU DEV!
