Requires at least: 3.1

Stable tag: 2.0.4

The lite version of our complete WordPress eCommerce plugin

== Description ==

MarketPress brings you a solid, simple yet extensible foundation for a WordPress-Powered store.

The first WordPress e-commerce plugin designed from the ground up for seamless integration with WP Multisite and BuddyPress.

We went to great lengths to provide simple Shipping and Gateway plugin APIs, and very robust themeing support and a set of completely documented template tags. MarketPress makes full use of the custom post types, taxonomies, etc. of WP 3.0 so it creates NO messy custom tables for each blog that crowd your DB like other shop plugins out there!
